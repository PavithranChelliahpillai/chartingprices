# chartingprices
Charting stock prices - used BTC-USD to demo as it has activity 24/7.

## How it works
<ul>
  <li>Every 1 minute, data is sampled and placed into a dataset</li>
  <li>After the dataset is updated, a new charting is made with matplotLib</li>
  <li>Themed neon green, removed all the gridlines, and auto adjusting (if data hits extrema)</li>
</ul>
<br>
## Future ideas
<ul>
  <li>Make every image replace the previous such that there isn't an excess amount of images</li>
  <li>Make it fully fluid - reflects the changes every second</li>
</ul>
